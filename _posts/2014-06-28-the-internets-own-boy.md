I recently got the time to sit down and watch *The Internet's Own Boy*.<!-- more --> It's a biography of Aaron Swartz that also charts recent Internet history with regard to the censorship (SOPA and PIPA in particular) and Free Culture. It's a well-made film that explains the viewpoints and motivations of the people involved very effectively, whilst also giving a good grounding in the wider topics and not assuming any existing knowledge on the part of the viewer. It's a great movie and I recommend you take the time to watch it. It's free and was released under one of Aaron's own Creative Commons licenses (as is the content of this site), so I'm free to share the whole thing with you below. Keep some tissues handy.
