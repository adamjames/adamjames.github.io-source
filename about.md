Hi there. I'm __Adam James__. I'm a software developer and graduate of [Hull University](http://www.hull.ac.uk) working for [MICROS Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MICROS_Systems) in the UK. You can find the mess I've made in various places around the web by visiting [adamjames.me](http://www.adamjames.me).

I have many interests, but I particularly enjoy following developments in computing, software and security and read several industry-related [blogs](http://www.joelonsoftware.com). I own two cats and am engaged. I look forward to watching media from security conferences like [DEFCON](www.defcon.org). I dual-boot [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) and Windows 8.1 at home. I own, but generally regret the purchase of, a MacBook; despite the number of times it's been the best tool for the job. I will shortly be building a Debian-based 10TB [ZFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS) file server (with [ECC RAM](http://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/238vqr/why_is_ecc_ram_necessary_for_zfs_but_not_for/)) and am considering a [Xen](http://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Xen_FAQ_General)-based architecture for my next PC. My preferred editor is [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) with a [package manager](https://sublime.wbond.net/), though [Github's Atom](https://atom.io/) is interesting. I'm a [mechanical keyboard enthusiast](http://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards), using a [Mathias Quiet Pro](http://matias.ca/quietpro/pc/) with customised ALPS switches – the quietest mechanical keyboard in the world. I agree with [Joel Spolsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spolsky) (an ex-Microsoft employee and co-creator of Stack Overflow) when he says that [these twelve points are very important](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html) and I also agree with [Jeff Atwood](http://blog.codinghorror.com/about-me/) (the other co-creator of Stack Overflow) on whether [using more than one monitor massively improves productivity](http://blog.codinghorror.com/does-more-than-one-monitor-improve-productivity/). I'd love to do public open source development, but unfortunately my employer owns everything I touch or think about while I work for them.

I first started programming in [Visual Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic), learning from a book I got in my early teen years. I dabbled a bit, then went on to learn [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29) at university. My current employer primarily uses [VB.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_.NET), but I still use C# regularly to keep it fresh in my mind. Recently, I have been learning about and applying the provisioning tool [Vagrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagrant_%28software%29) to my personal workflow; reintroducing myself to modern [MS-based MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc) outside of work (because the project I work on doesn't use it) and refreshing my knowledge of the source control tools [Git](http://www.git-scm.com/) and [Mercurial](http://hginit.com/00.html) because they're great (and again, because my employer uses [Visual Sourcesafe](http://www.highprogrammer.com/alan/windev/sourcesafe.html).) I've also been following [Heartbleed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed) and the [OpenBSD fork of OpenSSL](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/openssl-code-beyond-repair-claims-creator-of-libressl-fork/); the [Oracle API copyright case against Google](http://www.wired.com/2014/05/oracle-copyright/), the Snowden revelations and NSA tradecraft (particularly their [hardware implants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=b0w36GAyZIA#t=3229), automated MITM attacks and [interception of Cisco hardware](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140518/17433327281/cisco-goes-straight-to-president-to-complain-about-nsa-intercepting-its-hardware.shtml)); the upcoming [cross-platform version of ASP.NET](https://github.com/aspnet/home) and Microsoft’s open-sourcing of the [Rosyln](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/roslyn.aspx) compiler platform. I'm also interested in systems and network administration and would like to become [CCNA-certified](http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/certifications/associate/ccna/index.html) in future.

If I sound like someone you'd be interested in hiring and you're based in (or commutable from) [Hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston_upon_Hull), please don't hesitate to take a look at [my CV](http://adamjames.me/Adam%20James%20-%20CV.pdf) and [get in touch](mailto://adam@adamjames.me). I look forward to hearing from you.
